Anyway, my point is, we should just respect the fact that people have different opinions and just move along.",

I'm absolutely  terrified to be out publicly where I live because of how conservative it is over here and to even have a law that says I can't be discriminated against or lose my job because I don't fit their cisgender, heteronormative ideals. Or eventually go to the doctor and finally start HRT (hormone replacement therapy) without the doctor trying to make me jump through a billion hoops or treat me like someone who's got some kind of mental disorder. \n\nSo if and when _(hopefully)_ this gets passed I'll be more than extremely excited.",

To identify a person solely on what their genitals look like is actually a prehistoric concept.  There are documented bronze age societies who accepted that people are on a spectrum of gender.  We all share male and female hormones and there is little difference between us. A trans person identifies themselves by what the feel inside and rarely look at their genitals, but I'm not surprised that these Republican bigots are so uncouth.",

Because honestly saying that homosexuality is sin will by default be saying love is sin. Because love has no limits. Love is love, you can't say something isn't love just because You don't like it or just find it disgusting. Second off we're in 2015. We have the right to do what we want or what we consider is us. Anyone has the right to work as what they want. To go where they want. To be whoever they want. It's stupid to have to force people to all go in the same way. Also has anyone here who hated or doesn't like homosexuality considered how much suffering homosexual people have gone through? First off at school people bully homosexual children, not only is bullying one of the biggest causes for suicide but it feels horrible. I know that by experience. Second off some can't get a job because of that. And third off getting disowned by your own family when you come out. Or loosing friends because of that. That is hearthbreaking. And it also shows how some people are heartless. I know it's stupid to be making a whole hate comment for this on YouTube but it has to be said. And I imagine others have also said the same things as this comment. But it's true. Just because someone likes someone of the same gender doesn't mean it makes them a different person. It's like books one likes this one the other one likes that one. So what? Does that make them a worst person that they don't like the same thing as you? No it doesn't. I know I've changed a lot the subject around this but there's just so much that has to be said. Now I'm done and I hope one day people can accept that love is love. No need to deny that.",

I went through the same period of how I didn't like how I was being treated being Cis gender.. I was feeling hopeless,\u00a0 and I wanted my voice to be heard and I felt in my heart being transgender was who I am... anyways years have passed\u00a0 i do still feel that I made the right choice.. I started hormones at 19 and im currently now in the process of getting my breast augmentation and my rhinoplasty age 29.. looking back over the years and what's its taught me about the world.. I've never felt regret towards myself or have never been influenced by others opinions.",

Now, for me, you guys are completely misconceiving Jesus and Christianity and don't get them right. Jesus always was on the side of those who are rejected by the culture. Jesus doesn't need to be defended, nor does Christianity. The majority of trans people do. I am not talking politics here, nor am I defending Biden. It just makes me so upset when we try to defend Jesus at the expense of people who might be suffering. The Jesus you are defending is not the Jesus of the Bible. Also, one of my closest friends is an amazing Christian and he is a trans man. One of the most beautiful and balanced people I have ever met. I thank God every day he is still choosing life and choosing God.\n\n\nBtw, I immigrated from the Middle East. My friends and people lived their whole life under attack because of their faith. They are persecuted. American Christians are persecuted?? This is extreme self centeredness.\u00a0\n\n\nTo everyone who got hurt in the name of Jesus and Christianity I apologize, and I am so sorry. Today I choose to wash your feet as my master did. I defend Jesus when I love you. When I attack you to defend my dogma, I don't follow Jesus.\n\n\nHappy Easter everyone. Christ is risen!",

Claiming otherwise is.. pretentious, contradictive and wrong. But, you see, and here is an interesting point, religion is another form of control. Perhaps the most effective and widespread. It brainwashes people, depriving them of logic (oh, George Carlin, Christopher Hitchens where are you?) and intelligence. Supposedly, God, and which one of the thousands i wonder, created morality, ethics, and decency, thus he determines what is right, what is natural, what is good and moral. And, of course, without him, there are no such concepts. Which have existed for many centuries before him. So, lies, deceptions, manipulations and suppression of free will.. which leads to control.",

She told her teachers and classmates, her parents, and received a lot of acceptance and support. But she wasn\u2019t allowed to transition in her dress or sports classes. She saw a psychiatrist.  And in the middle of her senior year, after a very successful school concert, performance, she quietly went into the woods and hung herself.  The school received notification of her designation as a Presidential Scholar two days later.  Everyone was horrified.  Her parents devastated.  We will never truly recover.  I can only wonder, if she\u2019d been allowed to transition in school and find true acceptance with her peers, (she was very popular and a class leader), if the headlines about transgender students were not primarily about not being allowed to use gender appropriate bathrooms, about the murder rates for trans women, about the Republican attacks on transgender medical care, if she\u2019d been able to find a supportive societal context in which to face her personal fears about her identity and the necessity of transitioning, perhaps she would still be with us, and able to contribute her brilliant mind and kindly spirit to solving some of the challenges we face today.  Hate is cheap and lazy. And so very expensive in terms on human potential. And so very ungodly.",

Even the evangelicals are coming around:\u00a0\n\nhttp://time.com/3669024/evangelicals-gay-marriage/\u00a0\n\nhttp://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/07/evangelicals-gay-marriage-108608.html#.VVuHoflViko\n\nThe fine Christian people below all attend churches where gay people are fully accepted.\n\u00a0\nPresident Carter: \u201cHomosexuality was well known in the ancient world, well before Christ was born and Jesus never said a word about homosexuality. In all of his teachings about multiple things \u2013 he never said that gay people should be condemned. I personally think it is very fine for gay people to be married in civil ceremonies.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nKristin Chenoweth: \u201cIf Jesus was to walk the Earth today . . . (he) would be horrified. Those people saying they\u2019re doing it (denigrating gay people) in the name of God? No no no no no. It is very anti-Christian of them . . . It is the antithesis of what I believe. It is the antithesis of what you should believe if you believe in Jesus. . . It\u2019s not what he taught, it\u2019s the opposite of what he taught.\u201d\u00a0\n\nCarrie Underwood: \u201cI\u2019m in favor of acceptance. And I am a Christian person, and I do love the Lord, and I feel no matter who you are, what you believe, how you live your life, it\u2019s not my place to judge. As a married person myself, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be told I can\u2019t marry somebody I love, and want to marry. I can\u2019t imagine how that must feel. I definitely think we should all have the right to love, and love publicly, the people that we want to love.\u201c\u00a0\n\nAnd the times, they are a'changing. All the best!",

So ironic! \ud83d\ude02 If a trans girl competes against girls, people are so quick to call them a 'he' and complain and say that they must compete as the gender they were born with.\nNow when a trans boy who is born female completes as the gender they were born with those same people complain and call them 'he' and again complain about woman's rights. I think these people are trying to exclude trans people from all sports. \nI have a thought. Perhaps we should consider being trans as a biological advantage, just like being born tall or being big boned. Sport is never a level playing field, so why try to disqualify someone just cos they are trans. And No, trans people do not just change genders to win sports.",

Gavin Newsom is a breath of fresh air in American politics, that we need to bring up-front-and-center in our national debates. This is a STRONG Democrat that's not afraid to speak the truth. Keep an eye out for when he announces his Presidential candidacy, say 2028. So far he's got my vote!",

The moment they remember that whatever they chose to do in their bedrooms is their business and not everyone else's, that'll be the day we might consider what else they've got going for them other than their gayness.

He stated that he was a holy man and that is the real reason he does not like transgender in the military.  I am not saying the government should pay for their surgery.  But if these men and women are willing to fight for our rights and freedoms then what is the issue with them being in the military.  If by now we do not understand that men have a penis and women have a vagina and we cannot look at the other without being sexually driven then we have lost our society.  We have a all Volunteer force and it makes many types of people to keep it strong.  At first blacks were not allowed, then women were not allowed, then gays were not allowed to serve us.  Tucker says he would love to serve the country..  He was young once and had a chance and did not do it!!!  So now he wants to judge those who are willing to die to protect us!!!

Black queer kids are dying everyday for the toxic shit hes putting out in this community, and we dont get to move on till we fucking address it",

I did some research ! and all I can say is it\u2019s so sad  how hateful one can be just because of who someone chooses to love. no one should face 14 or more years in prison because they aren\u2019t sexualy attracted what the world feels they should  be . every body wants to say gay agenda this and that  and the lgbt community  wants to force ourselves on the rest of the world but in reality we just want to be viewed as every body else .  It\u2019s sick that a leader can sit and stand on pure ignorance and hatred  and say that the rules that are in place are there for a response am I the only one that has a heart or something? Because it\u2019s hurtful to here that the lgbt community aren\u2019t allowed to adopt . or any relationship that they might have is not deemed to be the same as a heterosexual relationship and it\u2019s illegal to even be who you are as if it\u2019s just a switch u can turn off . This is scary and evil all in one since and vaguely sounds horrifying especially for what we had to endure in slavery days just bc the color of our skin .",

We have seen trans men compete with men with no issues, we have seen trans women lose to cis women... I have seen athletic cis women out compete athletic cis men, if you were arguing safety... maybe the sport is not safe enough for anyone.  Since when have sports been about fairness?  There is a hard limit to how athletic I could become, thus limiting the chances that I would be allowed to participate in any sport no matter how 'in shape' I get.  I will never compete against someone on Bryan Shaws level, even though I lift regularly... okay, I lift a lot, but still a hard limit on how far I can go, so where is this fairness you speak of?  And why are you not stopping trans men from competing?  Maybe GOP politicians should chill out on the bs buzzwords and focus on fixing real issues?",

In this case this woman was born in the wrong body but she knew she liked girls that's why even after getting her appereance the way she felt good at, she still married a woman becouse that's the sex she feels atttacted to.",

Goggle it and you will find out the truth. I am a Straight person. I still believe in a man and a woman. But it is not my job to Judge what someone else is doing for love. You have to remember first of all, that love is a feeling that no one can control. I have changed a lot of Religious people away from Religion, by opening their eyes and mind. Religion is all about control and manipulation, nothing else period. Anyone that says something bad to you. If you are Homosexual, just ask if they believe in Jesus. And explain for them nicely, that he was GAY too. They wouldn't believe you, because they have never been able to think for themselves. I have talked to a lot of Catholic Priest's in Europe, and they agree with me that Jesus was homossexual. But they are scared to say that to the World. Because then they will lose their Religious Status in the World... Please wake up and educate yourself before you throw stone at some else. We should all live for Peace, love, respect, care and compassion for each other. Stop all the Religious hate and judgement of others, how they love and believe..",

        "comment_text": "I feel like there\u2019s a whole lot of cognitive dissonance in this comment section. \nFirstly we have people who think this is a transwoman. It\u2019s a trans man, which means he was born a girl but underwent hormone replacement therapy to be a man. I don\u2019t particularly care about your opinion on if that makes him a man or not, I just think people need to understand what they\u2019re arguing about, since many clearly don\u2019t. \nThat leads us to the second issue, many people think that this trans man shouldn\u2019t be in this women\u2019s competition. There\u2019s two different thought processes. The first is that a trans man is a man, therefore should be in a men\u2019s competition. The second is that a trans man is a girl on steroids therefore shouldn\u2019t be in this competition because of drugs. \nThe problem with a lot of people on that first one is because to allow that, they\u2019d have to wonder if they should allow transwomen (male at birth, transitioned to a woman) into women\u2019s sports. That\u2019s the big part of this debate. \nThe problem with the second one is that now you\u2019re requiring someone to choose. Either pursue being the person you want to be, in this boy\u2019s case, a man, but be not allowed to contend in something you love, wrestling. Or give up being a man, be miserable, but at least be able to enjoy wrestling. \nThat doesn\u2019t seem rightly fair. I understand it\u2019s a nuanced subject, and while I do support trans rights, I also think it\u2019s not as simple as joining whatever group you identify as, because that can ignore physical differences.\nBut as long as so many of you ignore that trans men are men, and trans women are women, nothing will improve. Once the lot of you accept that these people are valid, maybe then we can work toward figuring out a system that allows them to be who they are without disrupting the careers of both them as well as other athletes that have to work with them.",

There is enough societal/peer pressure to dissuade people from purposely causing awkwardness in the restroom.  There are already laws in place that make it illegal for ANY person to attack, molest, stalk, or otherwise harm another person in a restroom or anywhere else.  \n\nSo what problems do these anti-trans restroom laws/rules solve?  None.  \n\nHow would they be enforced?  Badly, for sure.  Imagine being a very tall woman or a short feminine looking man and getting harassed and humiliated by security every time you use a public restroom because some bigot is trying to guess if you are trans or not.  \n\nHow many problems would these laws create?  Lots.  Imagine some trans man being forced to use the women's restroom even though they are dressed like a man and quite possibly attracted to women.  Or vice versa.  Who is that helping?  That is going to be more uncomfortable and noticeable for everyone involved than if you just let them use whichever restroom they blend into best.  Most likely every one of us has been in a public restroom with a trans person many times in our lives and we didn't even realize it.  \n\nAnd honestly who cares?  Just use the restroom, mind your own business, and get out.  Who is hanging out in public restrooms long enough to notice or care about what other people are doing in there anyway?  Republicans and \"faux Christians\" apparently.\n\nThese laws were not created to solve any real world problems.  They were created out of irrational fear of \"others\" and to oppress trans people because they are \"different.\"",

The wedding was nice. The reception was fine and nobody had noses out of joint. But J & I weren't excluded. I even danced with the mother-in-law. I'm not married now, but I'll punch somebody in the nose  if they vote against people who just want to love each other. [Edit: it's been brought to my attention, that this was taken seriously. I'm  5 foot four. It is a joke. I have to punch upwards with everyone. But your ankles are free reign.]",

Not until a Franciscan monk named Thomas Aquinas in the 12th century. Hardly convincing evidence for any truly rational and spiritual person. ",

If they don't come out to you and simply introduce themselves as a woman, how do you know that they're trans? If you want proof, you'll have to do genital inspections. They're not adults. You also can't single somebody out and only investigate thsm, because that's discriminatory and is considered profiling. You have a problem with losing? Train harder.

To say that the transgender community is at war with Christianity is just backwards.  Anyone paying attention can see that there is a growing animus against the entire LGBTQ community.  Anyone who knows these people understands that they are far more likely to be kind, caring and gregarious people.  They just want to live their lives happily and be recognized for their personality and capabilities not their sexual orientation.  \n\nI\u2019ll gladly admit that I do not understand exactly how the LGBTQ community, particular the trans component, get to where they are emotionally.  But it is not up to me to figure it out or to judge.  As Jesus said \u201clet he who is without sin cast the first stone\u201d.\n\nYes, the young trans person that shot up that school went off the rails got what they deserved.  But that does not mean that trans people are evil and it is vile and despicable that you would propagate that notion.  You are doing this to distract from the real issue of highly lethal weapons in the hands of the wrong people.  There must be more control of these weapons.  The 2nd amendment does not grant the right of any person to own any weapon for any reason.  It grants he right to bears arms so that they can be available for a \u201cwell regulated militia\u201d. Two centuries later we have a formal well regulated militia.  It\u2019s called the national guard.  If one wants to carry weapons of war they can join the National Guard.",

I wonder if Clarence will be willing to also pass a law saying couples can\u2019t marry out side of their race??? I wonder how he will feel when that court tries to take away HIS rights! Many of these SCOTUS judges are working for their own beliefs and sets our country backwards. It infuriates me. I keep saying, They\u2019ve come for my rights. You thinking your\u2019s are safe? No, your rights will be next. LIVE AND LET LIVE!",

Mike Pence is a perfect example of a politician who doesn't even try to understand his constituents. You people aren't doctors and you have no idea what you're talking about. Politics is not church. Trans people have a right to live their lives in peace without other people's opinions or conditions. Ironically, Christians are persecuted all over the globe and that's a terrible thing, but then so-called Christian people turn around and persecute people they think are not Christian enough. Leave the transgender community alone. They pay taxes just like you and I. Quit snubbing your noses at people you think are less than you. I think the Lord would be disgusted, but he'll love you anyway! So, we have to love people any way they present themselves. I don't care what you think their sin is. Let parents take care of their own children's gender issues. Everything on this planet that God created has many variations. Whether it's plants, animals, or people. Doesnt matter. Grow up. Reach out to people different than you. Understand someone besides yourself. Get to know people before you throw out comments that degrade their very existance. You can't legislate people out of existence.",

Normal is 200 and below mine were reaching 108,000 anything over 10,000 can damage your organs. Doctors said I had enough toxins in me while in the ICU to kill five people over. I finally told my doctors I suffered gender dysphoria. And when I finally got re-diagnosed with gender dysphoria it took another year to find an endocrinologist to treat me. After I received the first dose of estrogen my toxin levels finally lowered to normal. Doctors don't fully understand, but they do know that my gender dysphoria and my muscle condition are intertwined. I'm taking treatment to save my life. Maybe ignorant fool shouldn't be involved in my health care or others. Lee is pandering for votes from the ignorant Evangelicals base of Republican voters.

Funny thing is there have been gay presidents before & FBI leaders etc but all were in a closet so I'm talking about openly gay leaders in those ranks.",

After a month of getting together and hitting it off, he suddenly disappeared without any further contact.  Eventually, I crossed paths with one of our shared acquaintances, friends and was informed what had happened to Matt.  His roommate had reported him to the LU administrative office for homosexual activity and he was expelled from, or, better put, kicked out of the university.  As part of the process, Matt's parents were called and told of his expulsion, as well as the reason as to why; he was outed to his family.  With his educational aspirations, life being upended, Matt had no other choice, if any, but to return to home in Massachusetts.\n\nI have thought of Matt over the years, wondering how things eventually turned out for him.  Having experienced something, almost, but not quite, similar as a part of an international touring music organization, I can only imagine the embarrassment and shame that he may have felt, but, most of all, put upon him by his family.  \n\nThe irony of the matter is the aspect of hypocrisy and, even, revenge to which spurned on the roommate to report Matt to the LU administration.  Unlike Matt, the roommate wasn't as open to being true to his self and living his life.  He had developed feelings for Matt and would show up at the \"community\" bar located in another city, an hour away from LU.  As made apparent by the shared acquaintance, Matt had rejected his roommate's intimate advances and had decided to moved off campus due to the situation.  The recourse was nothing less than an action of vengeful jealousy and completely hypocritical.",

Yahushua is the law, the Word of Yahuah, the High Priest of Yahuah, The Holy Sacrifice for sins, the Savior & the Judge of the living & the dead (those in hell).\n\nJohn 1:1\nIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with Yahuah, and the Word was Yahuah\n\nHence Yahushua says in John 14:15 :\n\n\u201cIf ye love me, keep my commandments.\u201d\n\nObedience to \u201cALL\u201d of Yahuah\u2019s commandments is so important that Yahushua decided to send us Yahuah the Holy Spirit as a Helper to live inside of us forever & to remind us of His laws, so that we do not have \u201cANY EXCUSES\u201d whatsoever not to obey Yahuah\u2019s laws, even when we do not have our Bibles (Jeremiah 31:31-33). \n\nJohn 14:26\nBut the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.\n\nJohn 3:5\n5 Yahushua answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, EXCEPT A MAN BE BORN OF WATER (baptism) AND OF THE SPIRIT (obedience to Yahuah's laws) HE CANNOT ENTER INTO THE KINGDOM OF YAHUAH.\n\nJohn 14:21\nThe one who has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me.\nAnd the one who loves me will be loved by my Father. I also will love him and will reveal myself to him.\u201d\n\nMatthew 5:17-20 - The Fulfillment of the Law\n\n17 \u201cDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. 18 For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. 19 Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, YOU WILL CERTAINLY NOT ENTER THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.\n\nXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n*EVEN THE ENDTIMES PROPHECIES OF REVELATIONS (The last book of the New Testament) - SAYS SALVATION IS BY OBEDIENCE TO YAHUAH\u2019S LAWS !!!*\n\nRevelations 22:14\n14 Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city.\n\nRevelations 14:12\nHere is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of Yahuah and the faith of Yahushua.\n\nXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n*HENCE NEITHER YAHUSHUA NOR HIS DISCIPLES ABOLISHED YAHUAH'S LAWS OR SABBATH OBSERVANCE*\n\nEphesians 2:8-9 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith\u2014and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of Yahuah\u2014 9 not by works, so that no one can boast.\n\nThis verse does not mean you can be saved without obeying Yahuah\u2019s laws, but it means that even after we have obeyed every law, we must acknowledge it was \u201cONLY\u201d by grace Yahuah chose us to be saved - For many are called, but few are chosen (Matthew 22:14).\n\nThe observance of abstinence from eating unclean as Yahuah instructed the Israelites in the old testament, are also enforced in the new testament. St. Paul, a new testament Apostle of Yahushua, even after Yahushua's ascension into heaven also reiterated & emphasized on the validity of Yahuah's old testament laws. Yahushua abolished only animal sacrifices & murder of enemies to distinguish between the followers of Yahuah & the beast -Luke 6:27.\n\nActs 15:29 \nYou are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell.\n\nNote: YAHUAH FORBIDS THE EATING OF PIGS (SAUSAGES, BACON, PORK), SEA ANIMALS WITHOUT FINS AND SCALES & ALL PROCESSED MEATS, processed meats are strangled, without the neck slit and the blood gushed, and the live animals are machine grinded. So we must abstain from even the meats we can eat which are processed.",

I fear for her because she is one of the kindest most compassionate and gentle friend to everyone.  It is frightening how paranoid people, politicians, extremist religious leaders, extremist press and on line conspiracy theorists scapegoat innocent people.  How would any of these people feel if they are the next scapegoats used by these people.  It could happen to anyone. This is how the Nazis came to power in Germany by scapegoating others and playing and exaggerating peoples' fears.",

This means that, for example, at one point, ALL creatures of the earth ate the FRUIT of the earth. In other words, man, lions, tigers, and bears all ate FRUIT. There was, during the events of the garden of eden, NO consumption of meat by anything. Yet LATER certain meats were declared \"clean\" to eat. Eventually, ALL meat was declared clean.\n\nAnother example: At one point, the only route to salvation was to be a Jew. Non jews, or Gentiles, were unable to achieve salvation, unless they became a Prostelitite (spelling?), which means \"a gentile that has become a jew\". According to the Bible you hold so dear, this is no longer the case in our current dispensation, the dispensation of grace, the route to salvation lies only in admitting to being a sinner, that one cannot save oneself from god's wrath, and to trust in the salvation provided by Jesus.\n\nThere are many cases where \"god\" changes his mind in the bible. I am not arguing the validity of the bible here, merely making a point that you have NO FUCKING CLUE what you are talking about.\n\nBut you ARE right about one thing: the Bible (a religious text) does state that same sex coupling is a sin. But that fact is a religious one. And so long as we live in a nation of....yep, you guessed it, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, and the actions of these people do not infringe upon your own rights, YOU have ZERO right to require that other people adhere to the constructs of your faith.\n\nI am immensely happy for the LGBT community, and I wish you all the best, but you have a looooong, hard road to walk. It will be full of hate, discrimination, hypocrisy, and laws that say one thing while another is enforced. It will challenge you every day of your lives, and will do so for decades to come, and will not stop doing so until every last vestige of intolerant thought is gone from human minds. However, it is YOUR road to walk now, so get to marching, and best of luck....",

Remind me again, who did Jesus buddy up to and speak to? Was it the popular members of society whom everyone loved? The richest? The most fortunate?\n\nI\u2019ll help you out. He sought out the outcasts, those who were hated. The sick, the downtrodden, the poor, and the disliked were His flock. It\u2019s horribly un-Christ-like of anyone who\u2019s outraged that we\u2019re recognizing the downtrodden on a day like Easter\u2014 but it\u2019s dogmatically Christian, sadly, as too many elements of the faith are used to justify poor behavior and discrimination.",

I say this because YES God made most men male like Adam, and most women female like Eve however God also makes some of us born eunuchs \u201cfrom our mother\u2019s womb\u201d which represent the LGBTQIA community today. This is a biblical and historical fact, and in fact since the word eunuch is an eastern term one we don\u2019t use anymore in western society in some parts of India and Pakistan the LGBTQIA Community there still identify as Natural Born Eunuchs today\n\nSo if you\u2019re LGBTQIA like me or care about someone who is LGBTQ+ the next time someone tries to shame, or discriminate against them by saying,  \u201cGod ONLY creates male and female like Adam and Eve\u201d just teach them, \u201cThat\u2019s not true as according to Jesus in Matthew 19:11-12 biblically speaking I\u2019m born eunuch from my mother\u2019s womb hence just as much a part of God\u2019s creation and design as his heterosexual Adam and Eve children.\u201d",

It was a 'how not to die and become extinct and not to bring chaos', the rules that should be always followed are the ten commandments and the teachings of the new testament.\n  Those homophobic \"Christians\" are sinning just by going to church on Sunday instead of Saturday (no offense against Catholics if you respect others and love God you're doing great even if you are breaking a commandment! Stay good sweethearts!), the ten commandments are the rules that should be strictly followed no matter what (they basically say 'respect and love others and respect and love God, also rest and pray on Saturday... You need rest) yet they condemn homosexuality like we condemn Nazism, in a similar situation Jesus said \"those who never sinned throw the first rock\" (I translated it from portuguese) yet they're throwing rocks like they are pure and innocent. If they really read the Bible and followed God's teachings they would know what they are doing is wrong and that they SHOULD RESPECT AND BE NICE TO THE LBGT+ and SINCE THEY ARE PEOPLE THEY SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE PEOPLE BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE YOU SHOULD BE NICE TO PEOPLE.\n  Not all Christians are intolerant, only the ignorant ones are.",

He made a joke about finding his son playing with a dollhouse and breaking it over his head, saying \"stop...that's gay\". It was a JOKE. It was not condoning hate or violence against gays. He explained that the joke was more about his insecurity as a Father being fearful of his son being gay.....which makes TOTAL sense. It doesn't make homosexuality evil or negative. The fact is, most parents wouldn't want their son or daughter to be gay, NOT because of hate, but because it's a hard life in our society. This is becoming an inquisition. The LGBTQ needs to choose their battles.",

Nor would anyone actually want someone who is against their marriage or fundamentally who they are to be a part of such a sacred thing! There\u2019s enough free market on things now, there are other options. And we are free to choose to not support businesses like it if we disagree. I know it\u2019s a slippery slope. Like- what if she\u2019s against interracial marriage? I guess like I said, I\u2019d rather have her business go under because enough of us don\u2019t tolerate it, or thrive in her quiet corner only catering to those she agrees with- rather than have a government force her. As a creative, if I\u2019m not comfortable or don\u2019t like you or what you\u2019re about for any reason I\u2019m not gonna work to create for you. Would you force a Catholic cake company to make a satanist cake? Because that is a religion..  it seems to me- they need to tolerate that others who don\u2019t agree exist.. & we need to tolerate that they exist. Campaigning to exclude on a mass scale is something else, but personal choice seems reasonable to me. \n\nThis isn\u2019t an age where the majority discriminates- it\u2019s the opposite now, & trying to force these sorts of issues to me obscures from the real discrimination going on, causing real damage- while giving fuel to those trying to feed fear of their rights being taken away, religious people being forced to do things against their beliefs. It almost feels as if this case was brought \u201cagainst\u201d her, just so some precedent could be set. Who even is the plaintiff? Typically spokespeople for the plaintiff in a case like this would be making the rounds of at least left leaning media. Instead it\u2019s seemed kind of non existent (maybe I just missed it).",

We enrolled an 15mos hemophiliac toddler who had AIDS from a blood transfusion. Other parents weren't told of course, he wore a helmet to protect his head from bumping while learning to walk, but tons of gossip and speculation. Not knowing anything, Parents did not want their child in his class or even on the playground when he was out there. Teachers were told his medical information, his parents agreed to all staff knowing, and they started requesting not working with him or wanting him in same areas as them. The owners as the school had their lawyers look into not allowing him to be enrolled but discovered the parents could sue for discrimination so reluctantly they let me enroll him. It was a horror show for me really, and I supported the family and loved the little plucky guy! They told me about 10 daycare centers who had openings all of a sudden didn't have one after learning about his AIDS.",

To quote the Asian man, do more Asians superheroes. Also Hispanics or something and I don't mean making them biracial like part Asian/black or Hispanic/black like they also always have a tendency to do.

She was married to tv producer David Birney. She has since changed her preference and is a self proclaimed lesbian. Look at Anne Heshe. She was Ellen DeGeneres' long time girlfriend. Now, she's married to a man. The 21st century rolls in and now it's called 'Sexual Orientation.'

        "comment_text": "The world has, pretty much always had various sports. Those sports have been historically played by, and along with human beings own genders. Male vs male, and female vs female. Sports have always had rules, or laws of the specific game being played. Especially physical sport, where the human body is the object/tool used to play the game. The very beginnings of sport is most likely two male members of a tribe, fighting each other for power/control of the tribes female's. The females who are able to still reproduce is the main goal/prize for the winner. This is a natural biological process. The animal kingdom is no different. This urge young males get to overthrow the older, weaker male leader, or for two young males in a group coming of age at the same time  is vital for life to continue, and to continue to be the best genetic offspring possible! Thus, making the bloodline strong, and enduring! Modern society has change the way we all choose our mates. We still have a desire to choose the best mates, and to be aggressive twords others who try to interfere with the relationship with our mates. Our brain power, allowed this type of society to prosper. We now channel our natural urge to fight, and our urge to observe a competition into organized physical sport. We as well have a desire to be fair when it comes to our sports. This is why we have the same types of physical sports. Yet we separate female sport, from male sport. Professional fighters are separated weight classes! Because a person who has 50 lb more muscle than the other person, it simply wouldn't be a fair fight. So, my question here is for the people who believe transgender people should be able to compete with biological/ from birth, gendered people is just fine. How could you believe that this is a fair competition, when physically, the opponents are not fairly matched?! I personally don't understand the logic behind transgender people competing in professional sports, where they know they are physically different than the other players! There is actually financial gain for doing so, in most cases here. Even gaining fame from doing this can translate into financial gain. I don't know, but I don't agree with it only on the basis of not being fairly matched! Sports are supposed to have fairly matched players! Otherwise, what's the point of playing? We need transgender leagues in physical sports!",

I know my friend. And he's probably the biggest shit poster and drama queen alive today. I guarantee you the attack had nothing to do with his sexuality, and was in direct response to something my friend said... I mean I've wanted to throttle him many times before myself.\n\nAgain... in no way attempting to excuse man slaughter or 2nd-degree murder or whatever this was, and have no idea who this guy was or what motivated him he might be a hateful POS... just saying that the news is not giving us the whole story and is selectively focusing on certain elements of it.

And (THEY DID NOT REPENT OF) their murders or their sorceries or (THEIR SEXUAL IMMORALITY) or their thefts\u201d\n\n(Colossians 3:5-6) \u201cTherefore put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication, (UNCLEANNESS, PASSION, EVIL DESIRE), and covetousness, which is idolatry. Because of these things (THE WRATH OF GOD IS COMING UPON THE SONS OF DISOBEDIENCE)\u201d\n\n(Ephesians 5:5-6) \u201cFor this ye know, that no (WHOREMONGER), nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience\u201d\n\n(2 Thessalonians 1:7-9) \u201cAnd to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, In flaming fire (TAKING VENGEANCE ON THEM THAT KNOW NOT GOD, AND THAT OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST): Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power\u201d\n\n(Isaiah 13:6-9) \u201cWail, for (THE DAY OF THE LORD IS AT HAND!) It will come as destruction from the Almighty. Therefore all hands will be limp, Every man\u2019s heart will melt, And they will be afraid. Pangs and sorrows will take hold of them; They will be in pain as a woman in childbirth; They will be amazed at one another; Their faces will be like flames. Behold, (THE DAY OF THE LORD COMES, CRUEL, WITH BOTH WRATH AND FIERCE ANGER, TO LAY THE LAND DESOLATE; AND HE WILL DESTROY ITS SINNERS FROM IT)\"\n\n(Revelation 21:8) \u201cBut the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and (WHORE-MONGERS), and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, (SHALL HAVE THEIR PART IN THE LAKE WHICH BURNETH WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE): which is the second death\u201d",

She represents a nation where being LGBTQ+ \u2014 and attempting to change one\u2019s gender \u2014 is outright illegal. \n\nThe basis for the accusations stemmed from a 2023 incident in which Khelif, and fellow boxer Lin Yu-ting, were abruptly suspended from the International Boxing Association (IBA) Women\u2019s World Boxing Championships. Both are competing at the Paris games. IBA President Umar Kremlev claimed that genetic testing had proven Khelif \u201chad XY chromosomes,\u201d and was therefore ineligible to compete. The specific tests conducted and their results were never made public, and Khelif challenged the claim. It should be noted that the IBA was stripped of its role in organizing the Olympic games in 2019 amid ongoing corruption allegations, and evidence the organization rigged matches at the 2016 Rio Olympics. \nCertain genetic conditions can result in some women having XY chromosomes with little to no indication in their physical presentation. The same is true for men, who can present the physical characteristics of a male while having XX genotype.",

Now I ask you this: What about people and don't have sex at all, but identify as being gay.  How do you feel about gay elderly people who don't have sex but claim a gay identity?  Should they ask God to take away the gay feelings and give them gay feelings?\r\n\r\nJust like you have heterosexual celebate people who don't have sex,, there are gays too.  Your opinion?",

This was JUST a review of the history of the movement \n\nTo say every thing on my mind becomes a HUGE topic  \n\nthere is a LONG history to dissect  in order to understand how we got here.  and there are  a LONG list of reasons why people don't like LGBT people.  \n\nThe LGBT community does nothing to change there negative public image and they react  to things  NO ONE has ever said about them.  \n\nexpanding on ANY of that would set up HOW we got where we are  but it leaves us with the question \"Why Now?\" \n\nI feel \"Why Now\"  comes from the multiple political movements  that happened in 2020. SOME event in THAT year triggered off a chain reaction of causes and effects  that told Trans people \"Now is the time\" \n\nWhat was previously ignored and hidden and avoided  was suddenly in the public where it could no longer be ignored and we had no choice but to acknowledge it.  Some factor , weather it was the other protests at the time or some one's court case or the people in charge, some factor motivated Trans people to speak up. \n\nthis leads to another question, why not sooner?

Talk about giving Christ the middle finger. Not only did you find a way to pollute this holiday. But you made it all about transgenderisum!!! May the living God above have mercy on your souls. At this rate, revelations is going to be fulfilled in no time. Repent of your sins while you're still alive. The punishment for sin is death. The Bible is very clear about that.",

That also is not bashing gay. \nWhat it is is Don Lemon, Chasten Buttigieg, and most media saying that by Tucker asking questions he is automatically bashing. That is twisting of the facts and in fact not using facts at all.... Just opinion!",

So when children are taken away from their natural parents either by death, neglect, or other circumstances you already have a broken situation.

I support religious or traditional\u00a0institutions not wanting to allow orphans to be adopted by gay couples.

Therefore, if we are going to talk about \"all that has been done for women's rights,\" how do you accept an honor made for biological women and not have issue with it.

Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin for girls only (surprise, surprise); Idaho, New Hampshire and, yes, Missouri, for both sexes.  This was a time when nine states, not necessarily among those above, didn't require a blood test either.  As usual, Republicans trot out one example of something that undergirds their argument, one teenage couple that one member happens to know of, without mentioning the millions of couples who stay together after getting married at 20, 40, 60 or 80 and not as teenagers or, my God, pre-teens.  You want to allow that?  Then you'd better be into the \"it takes a village\" thing, like in cultures where kids do not go to school until they're 21, where children do get married as teenagers because as much reproduction as possible is essential for the continuation of the tribe, but are then assisted with adult responsibilities involved in child-rearing by \"the village.\"  Is Sen. Moon ready to personally play a part in \"the village\" in his home town, and no, he can't claim to have a job to do in Jefferson City.  First responsibility is to make sure that family is taken care of.\n\nI would also like Sen. Moon to answer whether he wants this law to apply to two 14-year old boys or two 14-year old girls.

It just happened that the constitution states that LGBT ain't legal just like the US constitution did before being amended. Kenyans just don't think that the issue of LGBT deserves a discussion at the moment. There are a lot of LGBT in Kenyan streets, but they are not arrested or reprimanded. The African Culture and Hindi, Muslim and Christian religions don't allow homosexuality, so it's just a matter of choosing whether or not you wanna be an LGBT. \nThe president is clear that maybe in future Kenyans will want to discuss the freedom of the LGBT, but it's just not now. You can't force it on the people, it's the society that makes law. The US is a mixture of different cultures, and right now it's really difficult to trace the original cultures that inhibited the US back then, especially what these native cultures have to say about LGBT. But I'm pretty sure that they'll say NO. \nChristiane Amanpour, the President won't get himself on trouble by amplifying the people's view. Just check all comments below from Kenyans, and determine whether the President's in trouble with the Kenyan people.",

Thus, I don't Believe, I As A Leader Should Focus My Time Or Energy Towards Anyone's Sexuality/Personal Sexual Preference. If I May Add, Sexuality Or Who You Chose To Have Sex With Should Not Be Put/Flashed In Any/Everybody's Face Or Turned Into Everybody's Problem. I believe Sex/Sexuality Should Be A Private Business, I think That's The Way it's Designed/Supposed To Be. Besides, Sexuality Or Sexual Orientation/ Preference Have Not Been A Thing Of Public Discussion Until Now,  And it Also hasn't Been A Problem And I Don't Intend To Make It A Problem\" Thank You.

Lil Nas X is using polarisation and shock value which does not show artistic value or rebellion. Art and Rebellion are not about conforming and using propaganda. This is propaganda. It is actually quite narcissistic. Religion is a sacred space for many. Lil Nas X is more likely using his position and power to project his self-hatred and insecurity to make money. To say that Lil Nas X has no responsibility to his younger audience is irresponsible. Children are very vulnerable to imagery during development. Lil Nas X has only succeeded in polarising people. America has just gone through an immensely polarising time where division is apparent more than ever. It should not be a trend to polarise people, the world would be better if all people respected what is sacred to each other. I am a Christian and I am not homophobic and I despise discrimination towards anyone. To take something that is so sacred and use it as a commodity is disrespectful and discriminatory. It is not art at all, it is trash. To see that his song became No. 1 shows you how propaganda is powerful whether it is on either side of the political spectrum. His video is not nuanced it is just a blatant attack on the sacred space of many people.",

I consider myself an ally of the LGBTQ community but also think that there is a time and place for everything. Perhaps I'm just a coward who keeps his ear to the ground and lays low during vitriolic times. It makes more sense to me for the community to support lawsuits preserving their rights opposed to giving the other side fodder. The Lavender scare has been reanimated and I feel there will be more death/assassinations of LGBTQ if we persist at the moment. I have no issue with ticketed drag shows for folks and/or families to attend if they like, but to perform publically or Drag story time I see as completely unnecessary. Yes its art and expression but would it be suppression to reel it back a bit to be able to make meaningful progress or retain what is currently held.",

I later found out that women can have eggs that are predetermined to prefer only male sperm with X or Y chemical surface makeup to fertilize them \u2013 therefore, it is not solely up to a man to determine the sex of a child \u2013 a woman\u2019s eggs have a say in the matter.\n\nExample 2:  We all learn early on that identical twins are, well, \u201cidentical\u201d.  As I grew older, I learned that just as a heart does not break evenly when in love, a cell does not split evenly when creating identical twins \u2013 even though two people may look alike.  Also, there are different types of identical twins, \u201cidentical\u201d, \u201cidentical mirror twins\u201d, etc.\n\nWho\u2019s to say that there isn\u2019t something else, or combination of chromosomes to the whole gender thing?  Not me.  Maybe we\u2019ll all find out there is really more to this than just X and Y \"single chromosome biology\"?",

Pompeo says he respect's all people, and treats everyone with the respect they deserve, and his actions prove that.  Is Booker aware that most Muslims in the world would side with Pompeo on his views regarding LGBT issue?  Is Booker aware that the vast majority of Muslims in America would side with Pompeo?  Is Booker aware that everyone draws a line somewhere when it comes to dealing with \"perversion\" including himself that puts people on one side or the other?  And finally is Booker aware that you can disagree with someone vehemently and still respect and honour their right to make decisions.  Agreement does not equal respect.  I find it hard to swallow Booker's line of reasoning.  Could you imagine the secretary of state having to agree with everyone's personal practices and everyone's belief?  Pompeo has said he treats everyone with respect and honour as he should.  Is that not what we need? Respectful disagreement instead of forced uniform practice and beleif.",

On one hand, Mr Quigley is correct about just because some of the women using the facilities who are discriminating shouldn't set the standard.  On the other hand, these aren't women who are going for vacation, they are running away from hard situations and trying to make it comfortable for them is important, hence why a single sex home is constitutional even though it is discriminating against men who are the victims of domestic violence.  The solution would then be, there will be no single sex boarding homes for domestic violence victims.  Again, that is if what Ben Carson says is true.",

He was projected a s a 4th rounder when teams already knew he was gay, he fell to the 6th after the combine. He didn't tell teams he wanted to do a documentary on the O Network either, that's too much of a distraction if your the top overall pick, much less a 4-7 rounder. Teams hate Hard Knocks now, they didn't want to take the risk and they were proven right. I knew this was gonna happen, the second the non sports world get there hand on this story they'd yell homophobia. I'm surprised a Dale Hanson. Look at the facts. There are almost certainly other gay players in the draft that were picked higher cause there tape was better and they preformed more impressively during the pre-Draft process period.",

However it follows certain rules, that's what grammar is for. A language can be enriched but not distorted for ridiculous political agendas. They want to force language to say something that it will never say. The English language will not bow its knee to incompetent illiterates. Their agenda is to deprive the English-speakers of their rich heritage in History, Literature and all the other disciplines. They want to get rid of the richness of authors you have had throughout the centuries and feed you cheap propaganda. They want to impose conformity, uniformity and stupidity.",

Gender Dysphoria is not LGBT, but rather it is a very specific medical condition which relates to LGBT. So in essence the military is limiting peoples ability to participate in military based on those persons health status. If military banned blind people from being a pilot, no one would have issues with it. If military banned psychopaths from joining military, that will also make sense. So, clearly military has a legitimate right to limit medical conditions that can join military. If you ever had epilepsy, you cant join active duty... Gender Dysphoria is a psychological condition that can result in trauma and other psychological impacts / damage to the diagnosed person, making that person unable to perform military duties.  WHAT WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT is the medical diagnosis of this condition. If a gay male crossdesses into a girl, while playing with his partner in their bedroom, that is not gender Dysphoria. If that same gay male shows up to military base one day dressed as a man and next day looking like a woman, well then there is a problem in his head that he needs to resolve before taking on duties of military personnel.\n\nClearly the draft dodger commander in cheese is pushing his own agenda trying to ban all LGBT people from military. That is wrong! However this specific policy as documented by military and argued in court, does have a couple of legs to stand on.",

In its January survey, 57% of blacks approved of Biden, while 41% didn\u2019t. Now the numbers are worse: 56% approve and 43% disapprove.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe trend in approval by race and ethnicity since July shows a very substantial decline in approval among black adults, with smaller but consistent declines among white and Hispanic respondents,\u201d according to the analysis.\r\n\r\nThe black vote has been key to Democrats winning federal races for decades, but it showed weakness in the 2020 race, and that has sped up since.",

There are ppl who don't agree with seeing two old ppl have sex. Has he ever called them perverted? Has he ever called them evil, vile? I've never heard it from him. He works with homosexuals in President Trumps' cabinet or administration. He only follows the Bible. Just cuz you believe in one man and one woman marriage doesn't make you a bad person. I believe in one man and one woman marriage, but that doesn't mean I hate those who marry the same gender. I won't stop 2 men or 2 women from marrying. For me personally 2 men marrying isn't my thing, but if they want to marry that's on them, I can support individual rights and whoever wants to get married, but for me personally I am against it, cuz I am straight and will marry my future wife, but for individual rights I can say you do you. The Bible doesn't condemn 2 men and 2 women from marrying and I won't either, but it's just not my thing and that's not a bad thing to believe. As far as when it comes to sin I do believe homosexuals engaging in certain sexual behaviors like perverted sexual behaviors are sinning, but if they're engaged in a normal homosexual relationship or marriage they're not sinning. The Bible condemns homosexuals from engaging in perverted sexual acts, but normal monogamous homosexual relationship or marriage is not a sin according to the Bible.",

Quite opposite with the US and Europe where reproductive rate declined dramatically for the last few decades when channels like MSNBC were pushing the narrative of A- sexuality, LBGTQ+ child free families etc. This civilization will be soon in a brink of collapse and no return if MSNBC like minded ideologies would not stop their destructive propaganda.",

Nope, I'm a 67 year old woman, mother of 3 beautiful sons, wife and employee of a school system. If ANY of my terminology is incorrect and/or offensive, please know it is not intended. It seems to me, there is a degree of \"obviousness\" (ok is that even a term?) here that some folks see as risky to align with. It's a shame to hear about athletes (dedicated individuals sacrificing what I just can't imagine) to pursue a \"great love. \" In a matter of a very short period of time, futures and lives are changed. Yes, I'm just going to say it, call me  \"backcountry\" or \"crude,\" because \"yes, I'd be pissed too\". Keep yelling FOUL! ---I believe you have every right to. BEST OF LUCK",

Feeding and clothing of our citizens.\nInstead I see that our lives are trying to be controlled by a elite minority but yet they act as a majority, when they aren't in reality.\nAnd for those that are stuck in a blind twisted religious indoctrination.\nLet me use your own words.\nIt is better to pull the bolder from your own eye than to try and remove the sliver from your neighbors eye. Also Teach a man to fish and you will feed him for life.\nTry this your Savior told you to never turn your back on the poor or hungry, if he's hungry feed him if he is without clothes cloth him.\nIt's no wonder why our churches are seeing a lowering in followings, and will continue to see worse. Shouldn't you be more concerned about your own sins than your neighbors. Who gave you the rights to violate God's word and become Judge Jury and Executioner. REALLY! Someone please start asking",

They like to demonize the people they don't understand to the point of hating them.  They do the same to all of their neighbors who are not exactly like they are, and their preachers preach division and hate along those same lines. It is toxic.  Yes, Conservatives are toxic. They feed off of B.S., lies about anyone who isn't them because they have a deep-unhealthy need to have more rights than everyone else, and more power so they can persecute, oppress, and ban people that scare them because of skin color, accents, religion, sexuality... and to control the lives, reproduction, education, career, and everything of women.  They are a sick and twisted, radicalized, unAmerican, bigoted, fearful hypocrites who claim to be Christian but all of the things Christ taught and liberals embrace, Conservatives call that \"socialism\" or \"communism\" when trying to love ALL of your neighbors, trying to be humble, to be peacemakers, to be forgiving of others, to treat people the way you would like to be treated, and to care for the poor and needy... because we are kind people, and many get that kindness from their belief in Jesus and to others, being kind just makes sense.  There is nothing Christian in lying, hate, demonizing, oppressing, and refusing to help people in need.  If only Conservatives did try to live by the teachings of Christ, as they claim... we could all get along then.  But, their hearts are filled with fear, angry, and corruption.

        "comment_text": "This is Dave Chappelle people. I fully support trans people doing their thing, BUT I do not think all these kids, coming out and saying they are Trans, are for real. If 6 girls are hanging out and suddenly they all come out as Trans, I highly doubt that they all are. The laws of probability say it ain't so. That is what is happening out here and why people are saying that being trans is a fad. There are kids that are Trans, there are kids that don't know where they fall within that spectrum and then you have the kids that just want to be down and get all that acceptance that you get within the LGBTQ+ community. That community gives you support that you don't get in any other community. It's addictive to any kid that doesn't have friends or want to have a lot of them. \n\nOne of those girls was my daughter, and once she broke away from that group (it was 8th grade), and got other friends (she was accepted to a special HS focusing on performing arts, so at the new HS, her friends didn't go with her), she started embracing being a girl again. When she thought she was trans, she wanted us to buy her all kinds of boy clothes, she was talking about getting her breasts cut off, she wanted a shirt that smashed her breasts against her body to make her appear as a boy. She actually cut her hair short. She started re-remembering her past and rewriting her memories....she loved to play in the mud, hated dolls, but in actuality, she hated pants and would scream for at least a half hour if she couldn't have a dress on. She HATED to get dirty. With her dress on...if any mud got on her, the fun was over. She had to get washed up, in another dress and would go back to playing again. Some days, she went through 4 dresses. I hoped our re-direction worked because as much as we loved our daughter and just want her to be healthy and happy, we wanted all the normal everyday girl stuff. We didn't want all the stuff that comes with Trans, ie,...all the crazies that hate on them. Her hair is long, she is wearing clothes that accentuate a little too much of her body now (for my taste), she is talking to her mom and her new girlfriends about the boys that hit on her. \n\nObviously, not all girls will have the same experience my daughter had, but I gambled on the fact that my daughter was a follower. I didn't put my foot down on a lot of what she wanted to do, I just said when you get older (18) and still want to do some of those things, then I will see about helping you achieve some of those things. I figured she was 13 and if by 18 she still thought she was \"Trans,\" then she was. I told her, I wasn't getting her one of those shirts that smash her breasts either, but I would support her emotionally. I just didn't want to push her towards her friends even more. If you write me and say, there is nothing wrong with being Trans and try to talk shit, how about you go fuck yourself?! I support Trans, but definitely don't want my kids to have to deal with the issues facing the Trans community. Most parents want their kids to be healthy and not rock the boat when it comes to life. I think I rambled on and on, but I hope some of you get what I'm saying.",

Before that for ten years US has not army depending on 2nd Amendment militia in both North and South. \nProperty taxes were not to oppress slaves who it was illegal to educate in the first place. First major use in set up of Ohio Territories which were officially free no slaves. Property taxes are way more fair than sales taxes as Property taxes are Progressive. THe problem is letting white and well off areas in metro areas form little towns and cities to remove themselves from the African American parts of the cities. The problem is not Property taxes the problem is non inclusive tax districts. In fact all states should replace their sales taxes which are regressive hardest on the poor with property taxes. And tourist sales taxes just on visitors. \nLincoln had a statue put up for him by African American abolitionists many who knew him and freed slaves. But current lying left activists have had his name taken off schools thinking they know better than African Americans who actually knew Lincoln and new he was critical in passing Amendment banning Slavery. Modern folk object when they have no right to object to their own ancestors actions who knew better to slave on their knees being freed by standing Lincoln. A rejection of even being freed because the slaves did not do it themselves which was impossible. \nThere was no treatment for Gum disease and no dentists when George Washington alive most older people both white and African American's teeth feel out from Gum disease like Georges. Thus older slaves would have some to buy that Washington paid for in his leger which says nothing else about it. Lying left activists are he pulled them out of Slaves mouths but then why did he pay for teeth he was steeling there was no law requiring an owner pay his slaves anything owners did not even have to let their slaves have money. This lie plays on ignorance of tooth care in Washington's time. \nIt goes on and on\nOn MSNBC it even objects to requiring inclusion of Indian atrocities committed on whites a historical fact because it counter to the BIG LIE that the natives were peaceful never committed atrocities till whites did them to them. Utterly false. Both sides were savages. This why most tribes still hate near by tribes thousands of years of wars and atrocities committed on each other, steeling women and children which was done to whites as well. This what the objection of Indian names on teams the lie that natives were peaceful.",

Maybe the problem was not the bible, but me the whole time. \n\nSO YES \nI WAS AN ATHEIST,\u00a0 AND , HOMOSEXUAL FOR MANY YEARS, AND\u00a0 NOW ,I AM NOT . I GOT MARRY WITH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN YEARS LATER , WHO I LOVE , AND\u00a0 WILL DIE FOR HER JUST AS JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR HIS CHURCH.\u00a0 \n\nI REALIZED THE PROBLEM WAS NOT INTELECTUAL , BUT MORAL . \nI DIDN'T WANT A GOD TO EXIST ,\u00a0 CAUSE IT WAS GOING TO INTERVENE WITH MY \"HAPPINESS\" WHATEVER THE WORLD TELLS US TO FOLLOW,\u00a0 IF IT MAKES US HAPPY . (BIGGEST LIE IN THE HISTORY) \nI DIDN'T WANT TO FIND THE ABSOLUTE TRUE.

TRUST , GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRUST IN HIM .\nDON'T ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING, WITHOUT REALLY SEARCHING. \nALSO MANY PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY LOVE THE LORD ONLY AT THE CHURCH,\u00a0 AND OUTSIDE THEY DON'T (HYPOCRITE). YOU CAN'T NOT SERVE 2 LORDS AT THE SAME TIME . \nEXAMINE YOURSELFS AND DON'T JUDGE JUST HOMOSEXUAL PEOPLE ONLY, AND DO WHAT JESUS SAID OF HOW WE HAVE TO JUDGE OTHERS BY FIRST FIXING YOUR PROBLEM , THEN ONCE YOU HAD FIXED IT, GO AND HELP YOUR BROTHERS , SO YOU CAN BETTER HELP THEM\u00a0 .

That is why we have the NBA and WNBA, men and women's FIFA, Olympic sports divided into male/female categories, male UFC fights and female UFC fights, etc. True feminists would understand that allowing biological males (no matter their gender identity) to compete with biological girls regresses biological women's achievements in athletics. And people with clear-headed common sense understand that it is not transphobic to champion biological women's aspirations and achievements. If someone has made the decision to transition, it needs to be understood that others around them should not lose out on their opportunities for the sake of inequitable 'inclusivity.' Most level headed transgender folks would agree with this.",

I have come to realize over my long life that those who protest the most about certain things i.e. the sexualization of children and the like often have some serious deep seated issues themselves. \nPerhaps DeSatan gets aroused by his inner demons so much so that he takes it out on others. He really seems to HATE women evidenced by his extreme abortion ban. He obsesses over children to the point where it's actually sick and twisted. He is a bitter hateful man and if I'm right he wouldn't be the first Republican so outspoken to come undone as revelations emerge over time.\nHe is a fake, what you see is not what you get, that man has a dark and evil soul. What ever happened to twist him like this runs deeply, maybe mommy issues? \nDeSatan  is way worse than Trump can ever be and that's saying ALOT because Trump is a criminal in waiting for a prison cell. It's so easy to wrap things up in a tidy bow and call it Christianity but remember this beware of false prophets..DeSatan is not Americas next savior!",

Feeding and clothing of our citizens.\nInstead I see that our lives are trying to be controlled by a elite minority but yet they act as a majority, when they aren't in reality.\nAnd for those that are stuck in a blind twisted religious indoctrination.\nLet me use your own words.\nIt is better to pull the bolder from your own eye than to try and remove the sliver from your neighbors eye. Also Teach a man to fish and you will feed him for life.\nTry this your Savior told you to never turn your back on the poor or hungry, if he's hungry feed him if he is without clothes cloth him.\nIt's no wonder why our churches are seeing a lowering in followings, and will continue to see worse. Shouldn't you be more concerned about your own sins than your neighbors. Who gave you the rights to violate God's word and become Judge Jury and Executioner. REALLY! Someone please start asking",

As an adult with her own child I still carry the trauma from having a dad like that, my life irreparably changed and damaged. So it makes me want to stab someone when I hear something as devastating as child SA used as a weapon. The ppl who loved and cared for me are painted with this false label by ppl who\u2019d have embraced my dad bc of their twisted identity politics. He took me to church, that\u2019s all they\u2019d care about. The same ppl who thought he should have custody of me even with the protective orders, bc at least he wasn\u2019t a \u201cqu\u20ac\u20acr\u201d. These ppl don\u2019t care about kids bc ppl who care about kids don\u2019t use one of the single most harrowing things a child can experience, as a way of gaining political power. If you look into what trauma does to a child\u2019s brain and how it effects every facet of the rest of their life, then try to imagine weaponizing that, for decent ppl it\u2019s impossible. You have to be a completely soulless garbage human.",

I don't know any real people (outside of the Dems in Washington) who thinks allowing biological males to participate in female sports is in any way fair.  I've asked almost everyone I know who are from all walks of life including LGTBQ+ and even they don't think it's fair.  I want to gain an understanding from those who do think it's a good idea why you think it is.  And, please, leave \"feelings\" out of it.  I don't care about \"feelings\" I just want to understand how anyone thinks it is fair competitively for women and girls.  And just to be clear on my frame of reference, if this were a non-physical sport, like competitive Chess or a Math competition, I have no issue with males and females competing against one another.  If we allow this to continue, all female records will be history within the next 10 years.",

Depending on the way it's worded it shouldn't give the school ultimate rights to make decisions about non-medically required medications. Only emergency treatment for an injury or sudden illness or handing out something simple like ibuprofen. If they are signing away their rights in some way the wording should be in there easy enough to understand that it is something you don't agree to! I think parents could even make an addendum to the bottom of the agreement, disagreement does not extend to any treatment related to gender identity, etc. Know what I mean?",

My dad had long hair and everyone called him a girl until he grew a beard. So my question is why??? Why do boys HAVE to get their hair cut in order to fit in? Why do girls have to buy princess toys and look like Barbie all the time?? Why can't we all do the same things?",

Drag is a beautiful and storied performance art and should be celebrated.  The performance of Mrs. Doubtfire is drag, but the plot furthers the same damaging lie being used to ban transgender women and girls in sports, bathrooms, and life in general.  We can both admire the beauty of the art, and realize it is not the appropriate message on this topic.",

With these numbers,  how can people of color, Jewish decent, or part of the LGBTQ community support the Republican party--when it's clear they don't care about you (based on this poll).",

He has accused the left of trying to \"groom\" kids, a conservative talking point equating gender and sexuality discussion with priming for sexual abuse. But in the mid-2000s, Rochard supported a Brazilian president who one expert said had more in common, at least on economic policy, with the progressive politics of Sen. Bernie Sanders.\r\nRochard said many gay people living in the city of Niter\u00f3i at the time supported Lula, a left-wing reformer who served as president of Brazil from 2003 to 2010 and who was just reelected for a third term, starting this month.\"Lula promised to make laws to help us gays. They were all Lulistas and Anthony was too because he hung out with us,\" Rochard told Insider, using the name Rochard says Santos used in Brazil, \"Anthony.\"",

All of the United States used to teach moral standards, and when they stopped, we see what we have today.  Some children do not even know how to feel empathy for others.  Christian Schools are far superior to public schools, and the atmosphere is what most parents would want.  My son went to a Christian School for several years, and every race and religion was there.  I went into debt to do it, and I would do it all over again.  The positive atmosphere was a good foundation.  It is called freedom of choice.  Something that CNN criticizes.",

He of course uses the fake acceptance language - if this were racism, this pope is the *\"separate but equal\"* kind of bigot. \n\nSo, CNN; I'm sure you'll report when the Vatican no doubt walks back these statements today, which has been their tactic for this pope - pope says something that could possibly be construed as not monstrous, then the Vatican says he doesn't mean it. And it's not like you report on any of the monstrous claims this pope says all over the world, including his continued anti-condom and abstinence only policy in AIDS-ridden sub Saharan Africa, or the extremely dark undertones of his visit to Chile, for that matter. They were burning down churches in his arrival, ever wonder why that was? Oh you didn't even hear about that?! \n\nBut that's almost beside the point - *HE WAS TALKING TO A RAPE VICTIM* - that's not just a fancy title, this person was raped by someone in holy orders in the criminal organization that the pope is the head of. \n\nThis pope, like the previous pope *who we **_almost_** got into international criminal court,* (due to the overwhelming evidence of him being directly involved with international shielding of child rapists from justice) forcing him to resign, is directly involved in facilitating child rape and abuse - I can't remember if it was Chile or another country under the sweaty ass of the catholic church where a massive child rape harem was reported to the Vatican and we have a picture of the letter detailing the extent of the issue being passed from one of the child-rape department Vatican officials to what basically amounts to the press secretary of the pope. \n\nThat pope later arrived at the country and sat beside the grand leader and supervisor of that child rape harem to perform mass. That pope being THIS pope.\n\nIf you're reporting on the Vatican as anything other than a horrible criminal enterprise built on the misery of millions, you are not being honest. You are not being objective. You are not doing journalism.\n\nAlso movie recommendation: Spotlight. Won best picture, has Mark Ruffalo, Micheal Keaton - haven't watched it yet but it's a recent major movie on the church's overwhelmingly disgusting institution of shielding rapists from justice and ensuring that they're able to go out and do it again.\n\nAnd that's not even touching on the overwhelming moral and societal ill of their doctrines and the human cost of that, even if they never raped anyone or were against contraception and civil rights. \n\nBut again, *Shame on you, CNN.*",

I engage in activities with my girlfriend which we are meant to do only after marriage. I am ashamed of myself as a man for leading her astray along with me. But i pray that God delivers me from temptation & empowers me to make an honest woman out of her so that my union with her pleases him with respect to his law.\n\nlooking at pastors like this who feel no shame about perpetuating immorality & the below comments affirming his position (Not God's Position) is truly worrying, is it that easy to accept someone's theory instead of investigating first whether this is the will of the Lord or not? Sheesh guys. I know some of you will retaliate with negative and evil comments but know this, I rest in comfort in knowing that they hated him first. I am ashamed of my sin, i acknowledge that it goes against God's will. I also pray to be a stronger man in light of the temptation i face. I dont want to do it my way, It has to be Jesus' way under his guidance.",

His having a husband will automatically turn away most, if not all, Republicans and many Independents as well. There is no way they will allow a \"first husband\" to a male president, especially voters of my generation, who vote much more than young people. The only way that Pete can win against Trump is if ALL Democrats (I mean at least 98%) and a majority of Independents get out there to vote, especially young voters and minorities, who usually do not vote. But if they vote, he can win. If they do what they always do, we'll be stuck with Trump again, which will be the end of world democracy. This is the most important election in my lifetime. We have to get it right, or it's over for world democracy.",

But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself on the cross and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins. \r\n\r\nHe took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven\r\n\r\nJesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus Christ returns, he will take his children home, and hundreds of millions of people will disappear in a brief moment! When you see this event take place, please remember these words, and understand that the Rapture has just taken place! Please remember that the Christians tried to warn you of this coming day, and that God is real, and his name is Jesus Christ!\r\n\r\nPlease Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.\r\n\r\n\"And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.\" Revelation 22:12\r\n\r\nMay God Bless you all  with wisdom and hope during these dark times!\n\nThe END is here my Friends!\n\nWAKE UP!\n\nREPENT!",

As a nurse, I have never once stopped a person from visiting a loved one in the hospital unless the patient specifically told me they did not want visitors at all.  I've never once asked a patient about their sexual orientation because it's irrelevant.  If he wants the right to make healthcare decisions for his partner should his partner become incapacitated, then he can become his partner's Power of Attorney.  It really is that simple. \n\nA healthcare provider cannot legally deny care to anyone based on race, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, etc. If an LGBT patient requires care that a healthcare provider does not feel competent enough to provide, then they need to refer the LGBT patient to a specialist who can properly care for them.  Perhaps this guy thinks that referrals to another provider is the same as denying care (hint: it is not).  If a provider is heartless enough to tell a patient \"Sorry, you're gay.  I'm not treating you for your heart disease,\" then this provider needs to be reported because they have no business being in the medical profession.",

Gender identity struggles have been around for much longer than they\u2019ve been talked about. I think what we\u2019re seeing now, though, is a crack-down on people who \u2018invalidate\u2019 people\u2019s identities. As a society, we\u2019re starting to consider it disrespectful to misuse pronouns and what not. It\u2019s just a sign of the times. I respect people\u2019s identities, but I don\u2019t agree with shunning those who disagree. No one will ever agree with everything. Instead, we need to find a way to coexist. To make people who aren\u2019t cis confident without society\u2019s constant validation, and to teach cis people that the presence of other genders doesn\u2019t invalidate their own. Until then, we will have these issues.",

Its been used for years to refulate hormones in girls so no its not a new thing. As for the allowing 12 year olds to marry that is sick no 12 year old ahould be able to marry they arnt even fully developed and im sure someone is their saying exactly thats why trans people shouldnt be doing the medicine but im going to stop you because thats exactly why they should be able to do it because better results and safer.

When a transgender woman and the transgender community that you profess to support are telling you that you are in the WRONG, how is it that Piers still feels as though he is able to defend his position in the \"right\". He seems to be under the impression that as a cisgender white male (privileges he acknowledges), it is HIS RIGHT to define what terms should and shouldn't be deemed as offensive to the transgender community. UGH. Next he's going to try and educate us on \"\"\"cisphobia\"\"\".\u00a0\n\nIt angers me how Piers continuously refers to an interview written years prior, in search of justification as to why he misgendered Janet. She has talked openly about how problematic the Marie Claire interview was throughout the entire interview with Piers, yet he continues to attempt to put the words of Marie Claire into Janet's mouth. He also has an unwarranted issue with the fact that she didn't come right out and voice her grievance on her first appearance on the show, even after Janet so honestly pointed out that she was simply afraid. He quite frankly, did not care that Janet did not feel comfortable enough to initially raise the issue. Piers Morgan is a white cis male in a position of power, with a character comes across as incredibly condescending and intimidating. He must be residing on the ultimate level of insensitivity to feel the need to call her out on the fact that this is an issue she raised prior to the interview instead of during.\n\nIn the end, I am thankful for Janet Mock's gracefulness and strength, and for the huge backlash that Piers has received from the transgender community and anyone who does not share in his position as a blithering idiot.\u00a0",

In fact especially with the way the Church has supported this racist, womanizing dehumanizing president, I have les faith in the Church than ever especially win just under half of Americans are not religious. Not to mention even the Church can\u2019t agree on their own faith when the largest group of faith in the USA is about Jesus. Many are claiming religion just for the votes. If Jesus is the real true son of god, he would be horrified by the inhuman way we are treating his children like animals at our borders. Where are these great churches that support Trump on the border atrocities He is committing and even proud of. Many people on the fence about religion are turning away because of the hypocritical silence about what we as a country are doing to other people this very moment.",

Just because it\u2019s in Chechnya\u2019s culture to kill gays, somehow I should respect that? I think not. When you make such acts abnormal, you do perpetuate violence and discrimination, and a myriad of other domino effects. As a straight male, I\u2019ve never understood why adults care so damn much about what other adults do in the bedroom. Are y\u2019all afraid you\u2019re going to become gay?? Is that it? It\u2019s just weird and, frankly, unacceptable. \n\nHe\u2019s right in the respect that if society wants it, they want it. Doesn\u2019t matter what the government wants.
